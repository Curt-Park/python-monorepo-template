        # If you're not using a fine-grained remote caching service (see https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/remote-caching),
        # then you may also want to preserve the local Pants cache (lmdb_store). However this must invalidate for
        # changes to any file that can affect the build, so may not be practical in larger repos.
        # A remote cache service integrates with Pants's fine-grained invalidation and avoids these problems.
        cache-lmdb-store: 'true'  # defaults to 'false'
        # Note that named_caches and lmdb_store falls back to partial restore keys which
        # may give a useful partial result that will save time over completely clean state,
        # but will cause the cache entry to grow without bound over time.
        # See https://pants.readme.io/docs/using-pants-in-ci for tips on how to periodically clean it up.
        # Alternatively you change gha-cache-key to ignore old caches.
